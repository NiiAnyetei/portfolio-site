## What is C# Scripting?

C# scripting is a lightweight way to write and run C# code without needing to create a full project in Visual Studio. It’s useful for automation, prototyping, interactive development, and even embedding logic in other environments like Unity or web tools.

## How to Get Started (Quick CLI Setup)

1. Install .NET SDK (if not installed)  
   [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

2. Install dotnet-script  
   `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`

3. Create a C# Script File

   ```csharp
   // hello.csx
   Console.WriteLine("Hello from C# Script!");
   ```

4. Run It  
   `dotnet script hello.csx`  
   You’ll see:
   ```csharp
   Hello from C# Script!
   ```

## What Can You Do with C# Scripting?

- Try snippets quickly

  ```csharp
  var now = DateTime.Now.ToString("h:mm:ss tt");
  Console.WriteLine($"The time is {now}");
  ```

- Reference packages

  ```csharp
  #r "nuget: Newtonsoft.Json, 13.0.3"

  using Newtonsoft.Json;

  var obj = new { name = "John", age = 30 };
  Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj));
  ```

- Automate tasks  
  Script small jobs like:
  - Processing CSV files
  - Web scraping
  - Sending emails
  - File system automation

## Use Case: Renaming and Organizing Files in a Folder

Imagine you receive dozens of image or document files daily (e.g., invoices, receipts, etc.), and you want a script that:

- Renames each file using a timestamp format
- Moves it to a dated subfolder like `./organized/2025-06-24/`

## C# Script: organize_files.csx

Create a new file named `organize_files.csx` in your project folder.

```csharp
#r "System.IO"

using System;
using System.IO;

// Input directory
var inputDir = "./incoming";

// Output directory base
var outputBaseDir = "./organized";

// Create today's dated folder
var todayFolder = Path.Combine(outputBaseDir, DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd"));
Directory.CreateDirectory(todayFolder);

Console.WriteLine($"Organizing files from {inputDir} to {todayFolder}...");

// Process each file
foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(inputDir))
{
    var ext = Path.GetExtension(file);
    var newFileName = $"file-{DateTime.Now:yyyyMMdd-HHmmssfff}{ext}";
    var destination = Path.Combine(todayFolder, newFileName);

    File.Move(file, destination);
    Console.WriteLine($"Moved: {file} ➜ {destination}");
}
```

## Folder Setup

Before running the script, create these folders:

```lua
/incoming      --> Drop your raw files here
/organized     --> The script will auto-create subfolders like /2025-06-24
```

## Running the Script

Run the script using the dotnet-script CLI:

```bash
dotnet script organize_files.csx
```

You should see the log output for each file processed and moved.

## What the Script Does

- Scans all files in /incoming
- Creates a folder named after today’s date
- Renames each file using a precise timestamp (e.g., file-20250624-145500123.jpg)
- Moves the file into the appropriate organized/YYYY-MM-DD folder

## Customization Ideas

You can extend the script to:

- Rename files by prefix (e.g., invoice-..., receipt-...)
- Only process certain file types (e.g., .pdf, .jpg)
- Send a daily summary email
- Schedule this script using Windows Task Scheduler or cron

## Benefits of C# Scripting

- No project files or boilerplate
- Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Ideal for automation, prototyping, and DevOps tasks
- Easy to maintain and version-control like any other code

## Conclusion

Without the burden of a complete project setup, C# scripting is a strong yet portable tool for handling repetitive file operations, automating tasks, and testing concepts.

The wider potential of scripting in your everyday workflow can be unlocked by beginning with a straightforward use case, such as file organisation. The options increase from this point on: data transformations, report generation, scheduled jobs, and even API integration.

C# scripting is, therefore, a great place to start if you want to increase productivity, decrease manual labour, or simply discover a new way to use C#.
