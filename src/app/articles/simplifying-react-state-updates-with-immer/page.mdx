Updating state in React, especially when dealing with deeply nested structures, can become verbose and error-prone. [**Immer**](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) â€” a small, powerful library that makes working with immutable data much simpler.

Immer lets you write "mutative" logic while preserving immutability under the hood. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to use Immer to streamline state management in your React components.

## Why Is Immutable State Important?

Reactâ€™s rendering behavior relies on detecting changes in state. Immutable updates ensure that React can correctly detect when a component needs to re-render. However, manual immutable updates â€” especially with nested objects â€” can be tedious.

For example, consider this plain React state update:

```jsx
// Without Immer
const [state, setState] = useState({
  user: {
    name: 'John',
    address: {
      city: 'Accra',
      zip: '00233',
    },
  },
})

// To update the city
setState((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  user: {
    ...prev.user,
    address: {
      ...prev.user.address,
      city: 'Kumasi',
    },
  },
}))
```

## Introducing Immer

Immer allows you to write code like this:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { produce } from 'immer'

const [state, setState] = useState({
  user: {
    name: 'John',
    address: {
      city: 'Accra',
      zip: '00233',
    },
  },
})

const updateCity = () => {
  setState(
    produce((draft) => {
      draft.user.address.city = 'Kumasi'
    }),
  )
}
```

With `produce`, you receive a **draft** of the current state. You can then safely "mutate" the draft, and Immer ensures the original state remains untouched.

## Setting Up Immer

To get started with Immer, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install immer
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add immer
```

## Real-World Example: Todo App

Letâ€™s say we have a list of todos and want to toggle a task's completion status.

```jsx
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
  { id: 1, title: 'Learn React', done: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Use Immer', done: false },
])

const toggleTodo = (id) => {
  setTodos(
    produce((draft) => {
      const todo = draft.find((t) => t.id === id)
      if (todo) {
        todo.done = !todo.done
      }
    }),
  )
}
```

This is clean, easy to follow, and avoids deeply nested spreads.

## Using Immer with useReducer

Immer also works beautifully with `useReducer`:

```jsx
import { useReducer } from 'react'
import produce from 'immer'

const initialState = { count: 0 }

const reducer = produce((draft, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      draft.count++
      break
    case 'decrement':
      draft.count--
      break
  }
})

const Counter = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

## When to Use Immer

âœ… Use Immer when:

- You have deeply nested state.
- You're building complex forms or data structures.
- You want cleaner, easier-to-maintain code.

ðŸš« Avoid it if:

- You prefer to stick to minimal dependencies.
- Your state updates are already simple and flat.

## Conclusion

Immer is a great tool to simplify state management in React. It keeps your code clean and readable, especially as your appâ€™s state complexity grows.

By using Immer, you maintain immutability while writing code that feels natural and imperative.
